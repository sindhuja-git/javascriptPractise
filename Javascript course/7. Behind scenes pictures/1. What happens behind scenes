Our code - javascript engine that executes js code - JS core, spider monkey and many more

                        Javascript Engine

                                 Abstract syntax tree                               Machine code
Our code -              parser  ----------------------> Conversion to Machine Code ----------------> Code runs




all js should run in evironment - which stores properties or variables and consider a box whre our code is evaluated and executed - 

Global execution context is not inside any function - associated with global object - automatically assigned to window object 


when a function is called, it has its own execution context

 function definitions are still global exacution context


 Execution context in deatil - 
 
        execution context object 

        -------------------------
        variable object(VO)

        Scope Chain

        "This variable"

function called - Creation phase -\

1. creation of VO-

        - argument object is created containg all arguments
        - code scanned for function declarations: for each function, a property is created in teh 
           variable object, pointimg to the function
        - code scanned for variable declarations: for each variable, a propert is created in variable object,
            and set to undefined
2. CREATION OF SCOPE Chain
3. Determine the value of 'THIS' Variable
