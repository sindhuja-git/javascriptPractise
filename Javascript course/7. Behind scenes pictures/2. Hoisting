    console.log(2016 - year)
}
//27


//retirement(1990);

var retirement = function(year) {
    console.log(65 - (2016 - year))
}
//retirement is not a function

//Hoisting works for function declarations not function expressions


//variables

//code scanned for variable declarations: for each variable, a propert is created in variable object, and set to undefined
console.log(age)//undefined
var age = 23;
console.log(age)//23

function foo() {
    console.log(age)//undefined
    var age = 65;
    console.log(age)//65
}
foo();
console.log(age)//23


//Biggest takeaway - function declaration before we declare them in our code
