Type coercion:


var firstName = "John";
var lastName = "Smith"
var age = 28
var fullAge = true
var job;

*Joining strings by itself without changing number data type

console.log(firstName + " " +lastName+ " " + age + " " + fullAge + " " + job + " "  );




Variable Mutation:

var firstName = "John";
var lastName = "Smith"
var age = 28  //age=28

age = "twenty eight"  //age="twenty eight"
