store and use it over and over

variables are the boxes and values are what we store in a box. It holds data(value) and very important as if it is changed at one place, it changes throughout the 
file.

Values have differenet data types - primitive and object
var firstName = 'Sindhu';

Primitive data types :

1. Number - floating  point numbers,for decimals and integers
2. String - text
3. boolean - logical-true/false
4. undefined - Data type of a variable that do not have a value yet. Empty variable holds a value of undefined
5. Null - Non-existent
6. Symbom(ES2015) - VALUE THAT IS UNIQUE
7. BIGINT - Larger integers than number tupr can hold


  Do not have to manually define the data type. data types automatically assigned without giving type
 VALUE HAS TYPE NOT VARIABLE
 
* Dynamic typing  - we change change the type of the variable

typeof Null = object -> error in JS not addressed

Eg - let hello ='test'
      hello =35
      // put book in a box and then remove book and put phone
 * Camel Case is preffered
 * Starting variables with _,$ or character
 * No reserved key words a variables 
 
 let and const are 2 ways to declare variables
 
 const is constant value
 let is something that can be changed later
 
 const is immutable - const job; // error that we need an initial value
 
 let is mutable. We can change the value later
     let job = 'test'
     job = 'changed'
     it is mutable
 
  var is old
  
  LET and const are introduced in ECMA 15
 
 ALWAYS use const - good practice
 DO NOT USE VAR
